# Employee Payroll System 🏢💰

Welcome to my **Employee Payroll System**, a project built using **Java** in **IntelliJ IDEA**. This project is part of my **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) journey**, where I explore and implement core OOP concepts. 🚀

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java ☕
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA 🖥️
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub 🗂️

---

## 📌 OOP Concepts Implemented
This project is a practical application of OOP principles:

✅ **Abstraction** - Defined an `Employee` abstract class to represent a common blueprint for different employee types.

✅ **Encapsulation** - Used private attributes with public getters and setters to protect data integrity.

✅ **Inheritance** - Created `FullTimeEmployee` and `PartTimeEmployee` classes, inheriting from `Employee`.

✅ **Polymorphism** - Overridden methods like `calculateSalary()` in derived classes to implement specific salary logic.

✅ **Interface** - Added a `Bonus` interface to separate the bonus calculation logic from employee salary computation.

✅ **Constructor Chaining** - Utilized constructor chaining for flexible object creation in `FullTimeEmployee`.

✅ **Dynamic Data Structures** - Managed employees dynamically using an `ArrayList<Employee>` in `PayrollSystem`.

## 🚀 Features
✔️ Add new employees (Full-Time & Part-Time)
✔️ Calculate salary dynamically based on type
✔️ Bonus calculation for employees
✔️ Remove employees from the system
✔️ Display all employee details

## 🔥 Future Enhancements
🔹 Add **database support** (JDBC / Hibernate)
🔹 Implement **Spring Boot** for better scalability
🔹 Introduce **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
🔹 Implement **REST API** for remote access
🔹 Add **unit testing** for reliability

## 📖 My OOP Journey
This project is a milestone in my **OOP learning journey**. I started with the basics and progressively built a structured, scalable payroll system. As I advance, I will be adding more functionalities and refining my coding skills. 🚀

Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements! 😊
